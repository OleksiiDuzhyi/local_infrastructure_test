### ToDo list:
* Add a proper README.md.
* Add Usage section to the Makefile.
* ~~Cleanup Vagrantfile.template for it to only include monitoring and application VMs.~~
* ~~Allow for configurable RAM/CPUs in Vagrantfile.template or better yet - move them into a separate config-file.~~
* ~~Finish transition to only two deployment roles.~~
* Cleanup roles from redundant files.
* Make grafana dashboard configurable.
* Properly override telegraf_config variable.


* If any time left: add unit-tests using molecule
