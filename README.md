### ToDo list:
* Add a proper README.md.
* Add Usage section to the Makefile.
* Cleanup Vagrantfile.template for it to only include monitoring and application VMs.
* Allow for configurable RAM/CPUs in Vagrantfile.template or better yet - move them into a separate config-file.
* Finish transition to only two deployment roles.
* Cleanup roles from redundant files.
